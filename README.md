# Pokémon Memory Game

A dynamic, interactive **React-based memory game** built to demonstrate state management, component architecture, and API integration skills. Players test their memory by clicking unique Pokémon cards without repeating any previous selections, while the app tracks scores and dynamically shuffles the cards.

## 🚀 Features

- **Memory-based gameplay:** Click Pokémon cards without repeating selections.  
- **Score tracking:** Tracks current score and best score across rounds.  
- **Dynamic content:** Fetches Pokémon data in real-time using [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/).  
- **Interactive UI:** Shuffles all Pokémon cards after every click to keep the game challenging.  
- **Responsive components:** Modular `Card`, `Body`, and `Header` components for maintainable and reusable code.
